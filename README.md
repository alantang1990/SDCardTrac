SDCardTrac - An external storage tracking app for Android
=========================================================

Description
-----------

The SDcard storage tracker application is meant to:

1. Record changes to the file-system
2. Report these changes to the user as a graph showing usage over time
3. Alert about space-hogging stale data (yet to be implemented)
